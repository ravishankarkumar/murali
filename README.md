# Murali

Murali is a Rust-based animation engine for semantic graphics and mathematical scenes. It is built around deterministic timelines, a frontend scene model, CPU-side projection, and a GPU-backed runtime.

## Documentation and cookbook

- Project overview: [Project Overview](https://muraliengine.com)
- Scene and app docs: [Scene and App](https://muraliengine.com/docs/scene-and-app)
- Internal architecture: [Architecture Overview](https://muraliengine.com/docs/architecture/overview)
- Youtube showcase [Murali Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@muraliengine)
- Reference examples in this repo: [examples/README.md](./examples/README.md)
- Creative showcase repo: [murali-examples](https://github.com/ravishankarkumar/murali-examples)


## Goals

- Predictable, explicit animation behavior
- World-space authoring instead of pixel-first APIs
- Clear separation between authored scene state and render/runtime state
- A modern GPU path built on `wgpu`

## Current Shape

- `src/frontend/` contains user-facing tattvas, animations, layout helpers, and scene authoring APIs
- `src/projection/` contains backend-neutral render primitives and meshes
- `src/backend/` contains the sync boundary, ECS cache, and renderer
- `src/engine/` contains scene ownership, app lifecycle, timeline stepping, export, and config
- `docs/` contains the longer-form documentation site
- `examples/` contains the reference runnable examples for the crate
- `murali-examples/` lives in a dedicated companion repository for more creative showcases

## Getting Started

Requirements:

- Rust toolchain
- A working graphics environment for preview
- `ffmpeg` if you want video export

Install from crates.io:

```toml
[dependencies]
murali = "0.1.6"
anyhow = "1"
glam = "0.29"
```

Browse runnable examples from the GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ravishankarkumar/murali
cd murali
cargo run --example hello_shapes
```

The published crate excludes `examples/**`, so reference examples are available from the repository rather than from the crates.io package alone.

Some useful places to start:

- [Documentation](https://muraliengine.com/docs/intro)
- [Reference examples catalog](./examples/README.md)
- [Creative showcase repository](https://github.com/ravishankarkumar/murali-examples)
- [YouTube showcase](https://www.youtube.com/@muraliengine)

## Who It's For

Murali is for people who want authored, programmatic control over mathematical, AI, and explainer-style visuals in Rust.

If you like the kind of mathematical storytelling associated with Manim and want a Rust-native workflow, Murali is built in that spirit.

## Preview And Export Config

Murali looks for the nearest `murali.toml` next to a `Cargo.toml`. If no config file is present, sensible defaults are used.

Example config:

```toml
[preview]
fps = 60

[export]
fps = 60
width = 1920
height = 1080
```

A sample file is included at [murali.toml.example](./murali.toml.example).

## Status

Murali is under active development. The repository already includes:

- scene and timeline infrastructure
- preview and headless export paths
- text, LaTeX, and Typst support
- primitives, layout helpers, tables, graph tattvas, and utility tattvas
- write/unwrite, transform, text, and surface animation building blocks
