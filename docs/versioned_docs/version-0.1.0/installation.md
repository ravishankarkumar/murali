# Installation

This page covers the quickest way to get Murali running and the optional tools that improve the experience.

## Prerequisites

You should have:

- a recent stable Rust toolchain
- `cargo`
- a working graphics environment for preview mode

If you do not have Rust yet, install it from the official site:

- [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Optional but useful:

- `ffmpeg` for MP4 and GIF assembly during export
- `latex` and `dvisvgm` if you want LaTeX text rendering

Typst does not require a separate system install in the default setup.

## Add Murali To A Project

Murali is currently consumed from GitHub:

```toml
[dependencies]
murali = { git = "https://github.com/ravishankarkumar/murali" }
anyhow = "1"
glam = "0.29"
```

If you want a quick scratch project:

```bash
cargo new --bin my_scene
cd my_scene
mkdir -p examples
```

Then add the dependency snippet above to `Cargo.toml`.

## Verify Your Environment

This repo includes a small doctor command that checks common external tools:

```bash
cargo run -- doctor
```

That is especially helpful for checking:

- `ffmpeg`
- `latex`
- `dvisvgm`

## Preview Vs Export Dependencies

Preview mode:

- needs a working graphics environment
- does not require `ffmpeg`

Export mode:

- can always render PNG frames
- uses `ffmpeg` when assembling video or GIF output

If `ffmpeg` is missing, Murali still exports frames and tells you where they were written.

## Project Config

Murali looks for a nearby `murali.toml` next to a `Cargo.toml`. A minimal config looks like this:

```toml
[preview]
fps = 60

[export]
fps = 60
width = 1920
height = 1080
```

The repo includes a sample file at `murali.toml.example` in the repository root.

## First Run

Once your dependency is added, the fastest next step is:

1. read [Your First Scene](./first-scene.md)
2. create `examples/my_scene.rs`
3. run it in preview mode:

```bash
cargo run --example my_scene --release -- --preview
```

## LaTeX Support

LaTeX text rendering requires system tools:

- `latex`
- `dvisvgm`

If you do not want to install them yet, use `Typst` or `Label` first.
